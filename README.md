# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
<p>This Project allows us to effectively visualize and summarize Louise's long list of kickstarter campaigns that were not really organized in the beginning. Additionally, it allows us to pull results from the original  dataset without having to scroll down through every row and column in the list.</p>
### Purpose
<p>The Purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise by grouping the data in her kickstarter Campaigns in order to better visualize the results, therefore it could help her make wiser decisions in future campaigns.</p>
## Analysis and Challenges
<p>Even though there is a lot of information already provided by Louise's Kickstarter dataset, I feel like there is still not enough to determine what makes one
campaign successful and not the other. Of course we can see that in the past years, there are months where campaigns are more successful and months where campaings
are not so successful. However, we do not really know the reason as to why that is. I found that to be one of the biggest challenges in order for me to fully
help Louise. </p>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 <p>This analysis was focused on the Theater Kickstarter campaigns only. The results showed that based on Launch Date, (1) There was more success in the months of May and June, also meaning that the Second Quarter of the year was when most campaigns were successful. (2) These two monthss were also when the biggest number of
campaigns failed as well. (3) Overall, most campaigns were not canceled, meaning that they were either very successful or just never made the cut, January was the
month with most projects canceled. </p>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  <p>Based on goals, the campaigns with a higher successful percentage were in the, "Less than 1000" and "1000 to 4999" ranges. The campaigns with the higher Percentage failed were the more expensive campaigns, specifically, "45000 to 49000" and "greater than 50000". 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
<p>The part where I struggled the most was making the last chart "Outcomes based on Goals". I wasn't sure if i had to make a pivot table in order
to get the chart. Turns out ity was much easier than i had thought and I managed to get the results.</p>

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  <p>One Conclusion that you can draw out is that most successful projects happen during the month of May.  A second conclusion is that during the month of May, there are also more projects that have failed than any other month of the year.</p>

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  <p>Seeing the chart for "Outcomes Based on Goals", you can conclude that monwy is not really the problem. Whether, the project is successful or not depends on how good of a project it is. Of course, most successful projects happen to be more on the lower side of the goal (less than 4999), but there are also successful projects on the more expensive side even two prjects worth more that 50000.</p>

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  <P>I think that one of the biggest limitations of this dateset is that we really cant make much inferences based soley on gaols and launch date. Perhaps, knowing how much promotion for each project was made would allow us to make better decisions and help Louise out even more. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  <p>We could also create a table that filters the categories (parent and subcategories), by country and that could show us which type of programs are more successful per country and that could help Louise on her next projects.</p>
